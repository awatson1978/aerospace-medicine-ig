# Multi-Axis Gimbal Simulator

## Introduction

Multi-axis gimbal training is a critical component of astronaut and space tourist preparation for spaceflight. This page provides guidance on the implementation of multi-axis gimbal training as part of the aerospace medicine practice, including screening requirements, medical monitoring protocols, and integration with FHIR-based health records.

## G-SHOCK Centrifugal Trainer

The G-SHOCK Centrifugal Trainer is designed to prepare astronauts and pilots for the disorienting effects of multi-axis rotation and G-forces experienced during spaceflight. The simulator provides controlled exposure to varying degrees of rotation across multiple axes simultaneously, challenging the vestibular system and developing the trainee's ability to maintain spatial awareness during complex maneuvers.

## Medical Screening Requirements

Before participating in G-SHOCK training, all candidates must undergo a comprehensive medical screening to ensure safety. The following conditions are contraindications for multi-axis gimbal training:

1. Head, neck, or back injuries
2. History of dizziness or vestibular disorders
3. Claustrophobia
4. Pregnancy
5. History of seizures or seizure disorders
6. Cardiovascular conditions including hypertension, arrhythmias, or other circulatory issues
7. Height requirements: between 4'0" (1.22m) and 6'2" (1.88m)
8. Weight limit: less than 250lbs (113.3kg)

## Implementation in Aerospace Medicine Practice

### Pre-Training Assessment

Prior to scheduling G-SHOCK training, aerospace physicians should:

1. Perform a comprehensive review of the trainee's medical history
2. Conduct a targeted physical examination focusing on neurological and cardiovascular systems
3. Complete the G-SHOCK Eligibility Questionnaire (see FHIR resources)
4. Document clearance in the trainee's electronic health record

### Physiological Monitoring During Training

During G-SHOCK training sessions, the following physiological parameters should be monitored:

- Heart rate and rhythm
- Blood pressure (pre and post session)
- Oxygen saturation
- Subjective symptoms (nausea, disorientation, visual disturbances)

### Post-Training Evaluation

After each G-SHOCK training session:

1. Record any adverse reactions or symptoms
2. Document adaptation progress
3. Update training progression plan based on performance and tolerance

## FHIR Integration

The G-SHOCK training program integrates with FHIR-based health records through:

1. **Questionnaires**: Pre-screening eligibility assessment
2. **Observations**: Physiological measurements before, during, and after training
3. **RiskAssessment**: Evaluation of individual risk factors for adverse reactions
4. **CarePlan**: Personalized training progression based on adaptation and performance
